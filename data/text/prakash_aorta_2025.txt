Outline

How safe is exercise for patients who have 
aneurysms or dissections?
• Regular exercise is safe for patients with large abdominal aortic 
aneurysms and may even decrease expansion rate
• Cardiac rehabilitation exercises after aortic repair appear to be safe 
(France, US, Swiss)
• In mice with Marfan syndrome gene mutations, regular exercise slows 
aortic disease progression
• Light to moderate-intensity exercises are safe in patients with thoracic 
aortic disease and may decrease aortic dilation

Post-exertional 
hypotension
BP Response to Aerobic Exercise
• SBP increases gradually at first and plateaus
• SBP can be readily measured during aerobic exercise
• Provides opportunities to adjust intensity before threshold SBP is reached
• SBP increase may not be predictable from rest blood pressure
SBP 150-170

Post-exercise 
hypotension
Exaggerated BP Response to Aerobic Exercise
• Exercise BP is frequently not predictable from baseline BP
• SBP > 165 mmHg during moderate exercise predicts future hypertension, sudden 
cardiovascular death, and all-cause mortality (OR 1.33)
• Independent of BP , age, sex, and other established CVD risk factors
• Post-exertional hypotension is larger and more sustained when exercise intensity is higher
SBP >170

Exaggerated BP Response to Exercise: 
Risk Factors
*Relevant to heritable aortopathies
SBP > 190-225 mmHg

Beta Blockers or ARBs: Discussion
Favors ARBs
• Slow heart rate
• ECG abnormalities
• Diabetes
• Erectile dysfunction
• Mood disorder
• Hypertension
• Aortic regurgitation
• Sports participation
Favors BBs
• Rapid heart rate or fast arrhythmia
• Normal ECG
• Adverse reaction to ACE inhibitors
• Kidney disease
• Women who may become pregnant
    
3-week trial of medication
Log home blood pressures before and after medications
Recommend basic metabolic panel if starting ARBs 

Effects of Beta Blockers on Exercise
3. Effort slope increases
2. BP curve shifts left
1. Decrease VO2 max by 15%: lowers the threshold for maximal effort when BP can spike 
4. Heart rate may not reflect level of effort. BBs blunt the usual warning signs 
and potentially contribute to overexertion. 

• BP increases in proportion to the % of body weight lifted or force applied
• Increases are sudden and short -lived
• SBP can not be readily measured during exercise 
• Changes in BP vary from person to person depending on technique
• Limited opportunity to adjust the intensity of exercise before threshold SBP is reached
BP Response to Resistance Exercises
SBP > 250
DBP > 180

BP Response to Intense Resistance Exercises
2. High DBP
3. Valsalva
1. Stacking
Healthy Maladaptive

• Amount of weight lifted or force applied
• Breath holding (Valsalva maneuver)
• Number of repetitions
• Time between repetitions
• Strength or mass of recruited muscles
• Age and sex
• Medications relatively weak protective effects
Resistance Exercises: Conclusions
Magnitude of BP increase is hard to predict:
Resistance training has beneficial effects:
• Bone density
• Frailty
• Decreases central aortic BP and total peripheral resistance

Competitive Athletic Events After TAD Diagnosis: 
Conclusions
• Athletic activity after diagnosis of TAD is generally safe
• Up to 20% of endurance runners experienced pre-syncopal episodes
• Preventing event-related symptoms should include:
❑ Improved conditioning
❑ Hydration and ‘cool down’ period after exercise
❑ Strategic changes to CV medications

Exercise Counseling

3. Is aorta changing?
1. What is dissection/rupture risk? 
Regular blood pressure checks and medication adjustments
Updated imaging
2. Is blood pressure well controlled? 
High blood pressure, smoking, type of gene mutation, family 
history, previous aortic surgery, pregnancy
4. What are they doing now and what do they want to do?
Before starting exercise

At rest: 
120/80
During aerobic exercises:
165/90
During resistance exercises:
?
Guidelines Practice
• Blood pressure during exercise is frequently different than resting BP
❑Self-measured home blood pressure
❑24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring
❑Treadmill
Blood Pressure Control

• Get checked out before you start to exercise, especially if you have been 
inactive for a while.
• We recommend light to moderate aerobic exercise each day, with a goal of 
2 1/2 hours per week.
• We recommend light to moderate isotonic exercises (handgrips, wall sits) 
with a goal of  20 minutes on 2-3 days per week.
• Start low, go slow: low intensity, gradually ramp up.
Practical exercise advice 1 (do’s):

• You can lift whatever  weight you can comfortably lift without having to "bear 
down." Avoid isometric exercises where you contract muscles without moving 
joints. These actions increase pressure on the aorta. 
• Do not exert yourself to the point of exhaustion.
• Always ‘cool down.’ Don’t stop abruptly.
• If you take a beta blocker, heart rate zones may not be an accurate indicator 
of your exercise intensity. Instead, we recommend using a Rating of Perceived 
Exertion (RPE or Borg) scale.
Practical exercise advice 2 (don'ts):



• Submaximal treadmill test and 24-hr ABPM
• Exaggerated blood pressure response?
• Post-exercise hypotension?
High-intensity exercise, hypertensive vascular 
disease, high dissection risk, or post-dissection
• Adjust antihypertensive therapies
• Light to moderate resistance training is OK
• Ramp up slowly
• Frequent re-evaluations
