Thoracic aortic aneurysm 
ABSTRACT  
Heritable thoracic aortic diseases (HTAD) are rare pathologies associated with thoracic aortic aneurysms and 
dissection, which can be syndromic or non-syndromic. They may result from genetic defects. Associated genes 
identified to date are classified into those encoding components of the (a) extracellular matrix (b) TGF β pathway 
and (c) smooth muscle contractile mechanism. Timely diagnosis allows for prompt aortic surveillance and 
prophylactic surgery, hence improving life expectancy and reducing maternal complications as well as providing 
reassurance to family members when a diagnosis is ruled out. This document is an expert opinion reflecting 
strategies put forward by medical experts and patient representatives involved in the HTAD Rare Disease 
Working Group of VASCERN. It aims to provide a patient pathway that improves patient care by diminishing 
time to diagnosis, facilitating the establishment of a correct diagnosis using molecular genetics when possible, 
excluding the diagnosis in unaffected persons through appropriate family screening and avoiding overuse of 
resources. It is being recommended that patients are referred to an expert centre for further evaluation if they

meet at least one of the following criteria: (1) thoracic aortic dissection ( < 70 years if hypertensive; all ages if 
non-hypertensive), (2) thoracic aortic aneurysm (all adults with Z score > 3.5 or 2.5 – 3.5 if non-hypertensive or 
hypertensive and < 60 years; all children with Z score > 3), (3) family history of HTAD with/without a pathogenic 
variant in a gene linked to HTAD, (4) ectopia lentis without other obvious explanation and (5) a systemic score of 
> 5 in adults and > 3 in children. Aortic imaging primarily relies on transthoracic echocardiography with mag -
netic resonance imaging or computed tomography as needed. Genetic testing should be considered in those with 
a high suspicion of underlying genetic aortopathy. Though panels vary among centers, for patients with thoracic 
aortic aneurysm or dissection or systemic features these should include genes with a definitive or strong asso -
ciation to HTAD. Genetic cascade screening and serial aortic imaging should be considered for family screening 
and follow-up. In conclusion, the implementation of these strategies should help standardise the diagnostic work- 
up and follow-up of patients with suspected HTAD and the screening of their relatives.   
1. Introduction 
Heritable thoracic aortic diseases (HTAD) are rare pathologies 
with an incidence of approximately 1 in 5000 ( Fletcher et al., 2020 ). 
They are characterised by great variability in presentation and natural 
history and are associated with a high risk of aortic dissection ( Milewicz 
and Regalado, 1993 ). HTAD encompasses both syndromic and 
non-syndromic entities associated with thoracic aortic aneurysms or 
dissections that can in turn be sporadic or familial. These entities may be 
caused by genetic defects. Most of these conditions demonstrate an 
autosomal dominant inheritance pattern with incomplete penetrance, 
with the latter being mainly observed in non-syndromic HTAD. There -
fore, in addition to the known genetic defects, interplay between envi -
ronmental factors and several modifier genes is suspected. Although the 
number of genes involved in HTAD is steadily increasing, a significant 
number of patients/families with HTAD have no identifiable pathogenic 
variant, suggesting that other yet unknown disease genes and mecha -
nisms exist. Genes identified to date can be broadly classified into three 
categories: (1) genes encoding components of the extracellular matrix 
(e.g. FBN1, MFAP5, LOX and COL3A1 ); (2) genes encoding components 
of the TGF β pathway (e.g. TGFBR1/2, TGFB2/3, SMAD2/3 ); (3) genes 
encoding components of the smooth muscle cell contractile mechanism 
(e.g. ACTA2, MYH11, MYLK, PRKG1 ) ( Faggion Vinholo et al., 2019 ; 
Milewicz and Regalado, 1993 ; Verstraeten et al., 2017 ). 
In order to benefit from up-to-date professional care encompassing 
aortic growth monitoring and prophylactic surgery to prevent dissec -
tions/ruptures, a timely diagnosis is essential. This does not only in -
crease life expectancy and quality of life, but also helps to avoid 
maternal complications and adverse outcomes during pregnancy and 
expedites access to specialists and adequate services and benefits. 
Furthermore, family screening, facilitated by genetic testing, could help 
identify other family members at risk and equally provide reassurance to 
patients when the diagnosis is ruled out. 
Due to the increase in knowledge over the last years, with the 
recognition of many new entities, a need for a straightforward document 
describing the optimal “ patient pathway ” defined by professionals in the 
field throughout Europe was identified. At present, patient care is 
diverse across Europe, and national specialized centers and networks are 
not available everywhere. Hence, the aim of this document is to propose 
such a pathway to:  
(1) improve patient care by reducing time to diagnosis 
(2) facilitate the establishment of a correct diagnosis, using molec -
ular genetics, when possible, which can help achieve more 
personalized treatment  
(3) exclude the diagnosis in unaffected persons through family 
screening  
(4) avoid overuse of financial and personnel resources. 
This document focuses on the initial evaluation of patients with a 
suspicion of HTAD. It can be used both by non-specialized healthcare 
providers (HCPs) to guide them in choosing who to refer to a specialized 
center) as well as HCPs in specialized centers to aid in the 
standardisation of care across Europe. 
Comparable patient pathways that can be applied to patients pre -
senting with diverse clinical manifestations have to our knowledge not 
been published. Aortic disease oriented pathways can be found in 
guideline documents ( Erbel et al., 2014 ; Isselbacher et al., 2022 ), which 
have a more focused approach compared to this document. 
This document is an expert opinion reflecting strategies put forward 
by medical experts, and patient representatives, involved in the HTAD 
Rare Disease Working Group of VASCERN. The HTAD Rare Disease 
Working Group is one of the six Rare Disease working groups of the 
European Reference Network on Rare Multisystemic Cardiovascular 
Diseases ( VASCERN ), which covers a spectrum of syndromic and non- 
syndromic clinical entities with aortic manifestations. A total of 14 
healthcare providers representing 8 EU countries, 2 additional cooper -
ating centers from 2 countries and one patient advocate, representing 
the HTAD Patient Working Group, are members of the working group. 
The full list can be found on the website ( www.vascern.eu ). This 
pathway is a consensus at expert level. It was generated based on 
available guidelines when possible. Discussion items were listed and, 
where necessary, items were included in a questionnaire sent out for 
voting and discussion over monthly teleconference calls. This pathway 
describes what was considered an ideal pathway by the experts. How -
ever, adhering to this pathway may not be possible in all countries. 
Given the decreasing cost of genetic testing, it may become more easily 
available. We propose that this pathway is used as a guide when 
establishing local policies. It is available on the website of VASCERN 
( www.vascern.eu ) and will be updated regularly. To the best of our 
knowledge, no other patient pathway has been published on this topic. 
That being said, it is worth emphasising that defining “ absolute 
thresholds ” to decide whether or not to refer a patient for further eval -
uation is an impossible task and that many clinical scenarios cannot be 
captured in an algorithm or a pathway and will always require clinical 
expertise. Factors impeding the design of recommendations for referral 
of patients with a suspicion of HTAD include:  
1. The age-dependent expression of many manifestations, rendering 
evaluation in children very challenging  
2. The variability of the phenotype, and, in particular, the notion that 
syndromic manifestations are not necessarily required for a diagnosis 
of HTAD  
3. The fact that, to date, clearly defined diagnostic criteria only exist for 
Marfan syndrome 
Similarly, the expertise of people using these recommendations may 
vary with their background, so that the proposed scheme may have to be 
adapted to local expertise. 
2. Pathway elements  
(a) Thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) 
Definition: TAA is defined as an aortic diameter at the level of the 
root, ascending aorta, arch or descending aorta up to the level of the 
M. Caruana et al.

diaphragm that exceeds the normal value. In the general population, 
aortic diameters show a normal distribution. Hence, the probability of 
having a diameter above a given value can be derived from the z-score, 
which represents the number of standard deviations above the mean. 
Application of the z-score considers several factors that influence aortic 
diameter, namely patient age, sex, height, and weight. This is particu -
larly relevant in childhood, but is also useful in adulthood to diagnose 
abnormal aortic diameters in subjects of various body sizes. Given that 
statistically only 2.3% of the general population is expected to have a z- 
score above 2 (and only 0.13% of the population a z-score above 3), a 
higher aortic z-score signifies a higher probability of an aortic abnor -
mality that calls for further assessment. Different nomograms measuring 
the aorta from leading edge to leading edge ( Campens et al., 2014 ; 
Devereux et al., 2012 ; Gautier et al., 2010 ; Roman et al., 1989 ; Rutten 
et al., 2021 ), or using an inner-to-inner diameter ( Cantinotti et al., 2017; 
Lopez et al., 2010; Pettersen et al., 2008 ) have been proposed over the 
years. To avoid over- or underestimation of the z-score, the nomogram 
used for interpretation should match the method used for measurement. 
As a general rule, we propose the adoption of the most recently proposed 
method which covers children and adults and to use leading edge to 
leading edge aortic measurements ( Campens et al., 2014 ). We also 
recommend z-scores using height in patients who are severely under- or 
overweight. ( Devereux et al., 2012 ). However, the presence of multiple 
tools available underlines the imperfection of each of the calculations 
proposed, and comparison of various results may be helpful in difficult 
cases (online calculation https://www.marfan.fr/accueil/z-score-ca 
lculus ). For follow-up purposes, it is recommended that, for a given 
patient, the same method and nomogram is applied consistently. 
Measurement of aortic diameter to detect aortic aneurysm: TAAs are 
more frequent at the level of the aortic root or at the level of the tubular 
portion of the ascending aorta than in the aortic arch or descending 
thoracic aorta. Hence, views of both aortic root and ascending aortic 
diameters should be obtained during screening. The reference thoracic 
aortic measurement is usually acquired from a parasternal long-axis 
view using two-dimensional echocardiography. Leading edge to lead -
ing edge measurements in diastole are preferred ( Goldstein et al., 2015 ; 
Lang et al., 2005 ). When a transverse view of the aortic root is obtained 
(usually during magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computerised 
tomography (CT)), the cusp-to-cusp measurement, which is the more 
comparable measurement to that obtained during echocardiography, 
should be used ( Amsallem et al., 2015 ; Rodríguez-Palomares et al., 
2016 ). Cusp-to-commissure measurements tend to systematically lead to 
lower values than echocardiographic measurements. For diagnosing 
aortic root aneurysm, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) remains 
the preferred screening tool. However, the tubular aorta, arch and 
descending aorta may not always be easily visible on TTE, and MRI or CT 
might be required in these instances, with the choice of modality 
depending on local availability and patients ’ preference. 
The variability of the aortic measurements depending on the tech -
nique used and the method of measurement is important to keep in mind 
when considering the calculation of the z-score and defining aortic 
dilatation, and also for evaluating progression of aortic root dilatation 
over time ( Goldstein et al., 2015 ). When comparing serial studies to 
analyse for progression of aortic dilatation over time, side-by-side 
comparison of measurements using the same imaging modality and 
assessment method is recommended. Only differences in excess of 3 mm 
are to be considered significant. 
Criteria for further investigation: The z-score threshold value above 
which to consider a TAA to warrant further investigation differs between 
adults and children. 
For children, the proposed z-score threshold has been set at 3 in the 
latest diagnostic criteria for Marfan syndrome (MFS) published in 2010 
( Loeys et al., 2010 ), because small differences have larger impact on 
z-score in children than in adults, and the observation that a moderate 
aortic dilatation observed in early childhood is often not present later in 
life ( Gautier et al., 2010 ). However, whether this is still true with the 
more recent z-score nomograms remains unclear. We propose to use a 
similar z-score threshold of 3 to consider aortic dilatation to be signifi -
cant in children ( < 18 y.o.). However, a z-score of > 2 in a child with 
other systemic manifestations or progression of the z-score over time, 
should prompt referral to an expert centre. For those children with a 
z-score between 2 and 3 and no other clinical manifestations, we pro -
pose a repeated measurement after 1 – 2 years to evaluate progression or 
normalization. 
In adults, confounding factors such as hypertension and aging are 
important, and can be independently responsible for aortic dilatation 
mainly at the level of the tubular aorta ( Mori et al., 2019 ; Mul `e et al., 
2017 ). It is our recommendation to pursue diagnostic evaluation for 
HTAD in adults with an aortic z-score of 3.5 or higher irrespective of age 
or presence of hypertension, given that the latter alone is not a sufficient 
risk factor to explain such a degree of dilatation. When the z-score is 
between 2.5 and 3.5 ( Campens et al., 2014 ), diagnostic evaluation is 
recommended at all ages if normotensive, and for subjects < 60 years of 
age if hypertension is present. 
Although the patient pathway outlined in this manuscript is focused 
on diagnosis, we want to point out that the criteria used to define 
thresholds for surgery commonly use unadjusted absolute aortic root 
diameters and not z-scores, which is related to the fact that studies about 
aortic dissection risk mainly report absolute diameters ( Jondeau et al., 
2012 ; Milleron et al., 2020 ). Z-scores do have significant advantages, 
especially in the pediatric population, but sources of limitations 
including measurement error, validity of nomograms, inconsistent use 
of BSA equations and uncertainty of the natural history of z-scores need 
to be taken into account ( Curtis et al., 2016 ).  
(b) Thoracic aortic dissection (TAD) 
Definition: There are two types of TAD, type A and B, and both are 
rare entities. Type A has an incidence that ranges from 2.1 to 16.3/ 
100,000 inhabitants ( Wundram et al., 2020 ). Type B dissections may be 
slightly less frequent ( Acosta and Gotts ¨ater, 2019 ). The main risk factors 
for aortic dissection are older age, hypertension and underlying genetic 
aortopathy ( Evangelista et al., 2018 ). For the purpose of this document, 
arterial hypertension is defined as blood pressure values exceeding 
140/90 mmHg or patients treated with antihypertensive agents, in line 
with international guidelines ( Williams et al., 2018 ). Hypertension 
leading to aortic dilatation/dissection is usually longstanding, or not 
well-controlled, and often unrecognised. TAD presenting in younger 
patients is more likely to have a genetic origin and is less likely to be 
linked to a history of hypertension or atherosclerosis ( Januzzi et al., 
2004 ). Intramural hematoma and pseudoaneurysms are usually seen in 
the setting of advanced atherosclerosis, with a lower risk of underlying 
genetic aortopathy, and should follow referral rules set for aneur -
ysm/dissection only in the absence of atheroma. 
Criteria for further investigation: We propose further evaluation of all 
patients with TAD if there is no history of hypertension and patients < 70 
years of age in the presence of hypertension.  
(c) Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) 
Definition: BAV is a common entity, with an estimated prevalence of 
1 – 2% in the general population ( Braverman et al., 2005 ). In the absence 
of aortic stenosis or regurgitation, it can often go unnoticed. BAV is 
associated with a risk of earlier occurrence of aortic stenosis during late 
adulthood as well as TAAs, predominantly at the level of the ascending 
aorta, in approximately 50% of cases. The progression of these aneu -
rysms remains unpredictable ( Detaint et al., 2014 ; Verma and Siu, 
2014 ). Some cases of BAV are familial with family screening efforts 
identifying BAV or TAA in approximately 10% of relatives ( Cozijnsen 
et al., 2018 ; Galian-Gay et al., 2019 ; Massardier et al., 2020 ). Pathogenic 
variants in genes encoding for components of the TGF β pathway have 
been associated with more frequent occurrence of BAV ( Attias et al., 
M. Caruana et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               

European Journal of Medical Genetics 66 (2023) 104673

2009 ). The concomitant presence of BAV in patients with an FBN1 
mutation has not been found to represent an additional aortic risk factor 
in patients with MFS ( Milleron et al., 2019 ). 
Criteria for further investigation: TAA in the presence of BAV should be 
worked up further as per guidance set out above. Patients with BAV but 
normal aortic calibre warrant further evaluation if they manifest addi -
tional systemic features or if they are familial.  
(d) Medium-sized artery (MSA) aneurysms/dissection 
Diseases of multiple medium-to-large arteries or recurrent events, 
even in the absence of TAA, should prompt referral to a specialized 
center for diagnostic evaluation. This is discussed in more detail in a 
dedicated pathway available at vascern.eu/expertise/rare-diseases- 
wgs/medium-size-arteries-wg.  
(e) Extravascular features 
Syndromic HTAD entities typically present with a combination of 
several extravascular features. Since some of these features may become 
apparent prior to the development of aortic disease, their recognition 
can be crucial to early referral to an expert centre for evaluation of 
possible HTAD. 
Definitions: 
Mitral valve prolapse is prevalent in patients with FBN1 pathogenic 
variants (including MFS) and to a lesser extent in patients harbouring 
pathogenic variants in genes encoding for components of the TGF β 
pathway (including Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS)) ( Mühlst ¨adt et al., 
2019 ). 
Ectopia lentis is most commonly associated with MFS ( Ad `es et al., 
2004 ; Sadiq and Vanderveen, 2013 ), but can also be a feature of other 
genetic disorders. A diagnosis of ectopia lentis should promptly trigger 
echocardiographic and genetic testing of the patient and familial 
ophthalmological screening. Equally, a suspicion of MFS or the presence 
of an FBN1 pathogenic variant should prompt ophthalmological 
assessment for ectopia lentis. 
Facial features such as dolichocephaly, enophthalmos, down- 
slanting palpebral fissures, malar hypoplasia, retrognathia and high- 
arched palate are found in MFS ( Table 1 ). Characteristic features of 
LDS include bifida uvula, cleft palate and hypertelorism. 
Skeletal features are associated with some genes responsible for 
HTAD. Pectus excavatum (and, the less common albeit more specific, 
pectus carinatum, increased arm span, scoliosis (particularly with dou -
ble curvature), arachnodactyly (positive wrist and thumb signs), flat 
feet, spondylolisthesis, kyphosis, reduced elbow extension and dural 
ectasia have been associated with MFS. Club feet and cervical spine 
instability can be present in LDS. However, several of these features are 
not specific to one condition. For example, scoliosis, pectus deformity, 
dural ectasia and flat feet can also be encountered in LDS, and many of 
these features can also be encountered in patients with genetic variants 
in other HTAD genes. 
Cutaneous features include striae, particularly of the shoulders 
( Ledoux et al., 2011 ) for MFS and easy bruising, dystrophic scarring, 
milia and translucent skin for LDS ( Loeys et al., 2006 ). 
Recurrent pneumothorax: The estimated frequency of recurrent 
pneumothorax in patients with MFS over the age of 12 years is 4 – 11% 
( Arnaud et al., 2021 ; Boone et al., 2019 ). Although infrequent, it is seen 
more commonly than in the general population where the estimated 
prevalence is 0.01% ( Boone et al., 2019 ). The prevalence in LDS and 
other HTAD is currently unknown. However, pneumothorax in the 
absence of other features is rarely indicative of a diagnosis of HTAD and 
current guidelines do not recommend referral of patients for further 
evaluation of possible HTAD solely on the basis of a history of sponta -
neous pneumothorax ( MacDuff et al., 2010 ; Schnell et al., 2018 ; 
Tschopp et al., 2015 ). Therefore, it is our recommendation that a diag -
nosis of MFS or related condition should only be looked for in patients 
with a history of spontaneous pneumothorax that also manifest other 
features suggestive of such genetic conditions. 
Criteria for referral to a reference center: None of the above features 
alone are specific. It is the association of various features, not usually 
found in the general population, which carries a diagnostic value and 
should prompt further referral. In keeping with this thinking, a scoring 
system has been proposed in the latest Ghent nosology for diagnosing 
MFS ( Loeys et al., 2010 ), and this is summarized in Table 1 . As shown in 
this table, some features bear a higher weighting because they are more 
specific to the diagnosis of MFS and should thus prompt a higher sus -
picion. In the study by Mühlst ¨adt and colleagues, the average MFS 
systemic score in adults was 6.6 ± 3.2 in MFS, 3.4 ± 3.8 in individuals 
with a TGFBR1 mutation, 4.2 ± 3.7 in TGFBR2 mutation carriers, and 
2.1 ± 2.1 in those with a SMAD3 variant ( Mühlst ¨adt et al., 2019 ). In 
children, the systemic score is generally lower and early diagnosis might 
be hampered by the absence of skeletal features at younger ages ( Sthe -
neur et al., 2014 ). 
Based on these findings, we propose that a MFS systemic score of > 5 
in adults should trigger further investigation, while in children evalua -
tion is indicated in the presence of a systemic score of > 3. However, 
given that, as previously shown, patients carrying variants in one of the 
genes of the TGF β pathway tend to have lower systemic scores than the 
ones being proposed above, we recommend that the combination of 
features specific for LDS like bifid uvula, craniosynostosis, hypertelorism 
or osteoarthritis should equally prompt referral. Some scores or specific 
features have been associated with TAA ( Faggion Vinholo et al., 2019 ), 
such as the seven signs score for MFS ( Sheikhzadeh et al., 2012 ; von 
Kodolitsch et al., 2015 ), and the so-called “ thumb-palm-test ” in 
non-syndromic HTAD ( Blumel et al., 2021 ) and these may further help 
with screening. Equally, there are some features not listed in the Ghent 
nosology that have been separately associated with MFS ( von Kodolitsch 
et al., 2015 ). Thus, the presence of intracerebral arterial aneurysms, 
simple renal cysts at an early age, congenital mydriasis, or congenital 
heart defects such as BAV, coarctation of the aorta and persistent ductus 
arteriosus should also raise suspicion.  
(f) Family history 
A positive family history is defined as the presence of at least one first 
or second-degree relative with a thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection 
below the age of 70 years or sudden death below the age of 45 years in 
the absence of an alternative etiology. First-degree relatives of patient 
with HTAD or sudden cardiac death should undergo TTE (as well as 
other investigations in case of sudden death) and should be referred to 
an expert center in case of a finding of aortic dilatation on imaging. TTE

and referral of second-degree relatives can be considered on an indi -
vidual basis if first degree relatives are not available for screening. 
In summary, we are proposing that patients should be referred to an 
expert centre for further evaluation of possible HTAD in the following 
instances:  
1) Thoracic aortic dissection  
a. at age < 70 years with hypertension (age limit subject to 
modification)  
b. all ages in the absence of hypertension  
2) Thoracic aortic aneurysm (aortic diameter at any level)  
a. Z-score > 3.5 with or without hypertension  
b. Z-score 2.5 – 3.5 without hypertension (or < 60 years old with 
hypertension).  
c. Z-score > 3, a z-score > 2 associated with other systemic features 
or progression of z-score in children.  
d. The same rules apply for TAA in the presence of BAV. 
3) A first-degree family member with a HTAD with or without patho -
genic variant in a gene known to cause HTAD  
4) Ectopia lentis without other obvious explanation  
5) A systemic score > 5 in adults and > 3 in children ( Table 1 )  
6) A combination of features typical of LDS 
The HTAD patient pathway is summarized in Fig. 1 . In Fig. 2 , we 
provide some illustrations of the most typical clinical manifestations of 
syndromic forms of HTAD. 
3. Evaluation of the patient at the expert centre might include  
(a) Cardiovascular imaging 
TTE is the cornerstone diagnostic and screening imaging tool and is 
indicated in all cases of suspected HTAD in whom the presenting feature 
is not a TAA or TAD. Measurements should include the aortic root (si -
nuses of Valsalva) and ascending aorta ( Goldstein et al., 2015 ; Lang 
et al., 2005 ). Mitral valve morphology and function, aortic valve and left 
ventricular function should also be evaluated and congenital heart de -
fects should be looked for. 
Complementary imaging of the vascular system by MRI or CT is 
indicated in documented or high suspicion of TAA, to.  
(i) obtain baseline imaging which can be used for comparison if 
aneurysm growth is suspected during serial echocardiographic 
monitoring. This is proposed in all patients aged > 18 years or 
upon transitioning to adulthood  
(ii) exclude aneurysms at locations beyond the proximal aorta and to 
assess for arterial tortuosity ( Ciuric ˘a et al., 2019 ).  
(iii) optimize visualization of the proximal aorta (particularly the 
ascending aorta) when echocardiography is technically difficult 
(e.g. in the presence of pectus deformities) 
MRI and CT scanning should be used according to local facilities. 
MRI is the preferred technique for follow-up in view of lack of cumu -
lative radiation exposure, which is particularly relevant in younger pa -
tients, but CT scanning is often more precise. Both modalities should be 
used with ECG triggering to avoid motion artefacts and to facilitate 
reliable measurements of the aortic root and ascending aorta in a double 
oblique angulated fashion ( Goldstein et al., 2015 ).  
(b) Ophthalmological assessment 
This is indicated in case of a suspicion of classical MFS and should 
include a slit lamp examination ( Ad `es et al., 2004 ; Gehle et al., 2017 ).  
(c) Skeletal and facial evaluation 
The skeletal features reported in Table 1 should be assessed in all 
patients (features of MFS). Additionally, features of LDS should also be 
assessed, including hypertelorism, bifid uvula/cleft palate and (history 
of) club feet. Lastly, (history of) early onset and widespread osteoar -
thritis should be looked for.  
(d) Family history 
A three-generation pedigree should be established with particular 
attention for first and second-degree relatives with aortic dissection, 
aortic aneurysm, including its location, left ventricular outflow tract 
abnormality, and sudden death at young age ( < 45 years) by obtaining 
medical records to validate the diagnosis.  
(e) Multidisciplinary discussion 
The results obtained from the clinical evaluations should be

discussed in a multidisciplinary setting at the HTAD specialized centre, 
following which the indication for additional molecular genetic testing 
is evaluated. Different specialists such as orthopaedic surgeons, oph -
thalmologists, cardiologists, clinical geneticists and physiotherapists 
should be included in the diagnostic and management team at expert 
centers.  
(e) Genetic testing 
Genetic testing should be proposed when there is a high suspicion of 
an underlying genetic aortopathy and includes:  
- patients with a familial form with or without hypertension (2 first or 
second-degree affected relatives) of thoracic aortic dissection or 
aneurysm (TAA/TAD) ( Erhart et al., 2020 ; Wolford et al., 2019 ),  
- sporadic TAA/TAD as defined above, at  
• any age, in the absence of arterial hypertension, or  
• < 70 years of age in presence of hypertension  
- patients with non-traumatic ectopia lentis compatible with MFS  
- patients with a combination of TAAD and syndromic features of 
Marfan or LDS. 
The decision to proceed with genetic testing should be initiated by 
physicians with experience in HTAD. That being said, the indications for 
genetic testing are largely dependent on local availability and are 
constantly changing as a consequence of technical progress making 
testing cheaper and hence more widely available. 
Nowadays, multiple genes are tested within panels dedicated to 
specific diseases. The genes tested may vary from one center to another 
but should include the following:  
- ectopia lentis: FBN1 ( Ad `es et al., 2004 ) (panel should also include 
ADAMTSL4, LTBP2 (forms not related to HTAD)  
- TAA or TAD or systemic features ( Renard et al., 2018 ): genes with a 
definitive or strong association with HTAD: ACTA2, COL3A1, FBN1, 
LOX, MYH11, MYLK, PRKG1, SMAD3, TGFB2, TGFBR1, TGFBR2. 
This list is dynamic and will be updated regularly. The list of genes 
presently used in the various centers is available on the website of 
VASCERN. 
The technical capacity to detect small intragenic copy number var -
iants using NGS data is suboptimal, though algorithms have improved 
considerably over the last few years. Additional high-resolution copy 
number variant analysis should be considered in case of negative panels 
in patients with a high suspicion. Furthermore, after multidisciplinary 
discussion, in some specific cases, it may be necessary to consider whole 
exome or genome sequencing for diagnosis since deep intronic variants 
can be present, or other syndromes, like Alagille syndrome, Noonan 
syndrome and neurofibromatosis type 1, can have TAA as a rare mani -
festation. Despite this, a causative variant remains unidentified in many 
(roughly 80%) non-syndromic HTAD patients. 
4. Family screening and follow-up 
In cases where the pathogenic variant is known, it is proposed that 
family members undergo genetic cascade screening. Thereafter, only 
patients carrying the pathogenic variant will need serial aortic imaging. 
When the disease-causing pathogenic variant in the index patient is not 
known, follow-up by imaging (mainly TTE) of first-degree relatives de -
pends on how many first or second-degree relatives have a dilated aorta.  
- In familial TAAs (at least 2 affected relatives), aortic imaging should 
be performed yearly when the aorta is dilated and every 5 years 
when aorta is not dilated in first-degree relatives ( Erbel et al., 2014 ). 
Previous reports suggest the age of 25yrs to start screening ( Verha -
gen et al., 2018 ) – we recommend starting at the age of 18yrs. More 
frequent imaging may be necessary when the surgical threshold is 
approaching, when the aorta is dilating, or in case of more than mild 
aortic regurgitation.  
- In sporadic TAAs (only one family member affected), only the 
affected patient requires follow-up, and a single screening

echocardiogram is deemed sufficient in adult relatives ( Erbel et al., 
2014 ) unless the first test is performed before the age of 40 years, in 
which case a further test after the age of 40 years could be considered 
( Verhagen et al., 2018 ). In case the measured aortic diameter is 
borderline, a second echocardiography after 5 years appears wise. 
5. Conclusion 
This referral pathway should help achieve standardisation of diag -
nostic workup and follow-up of patients with suspected HTAD and the 
screening of their relatives. It focuses on patients with both syndromic 
and non-syndromic forms of heritable thoracic aortic diseases. It is 
subject to updates over time with better recognition of new entities, and 
with the technical progress and increased availability of genetic testing.
