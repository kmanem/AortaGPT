ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND Pathogenic variants in 11 genes predispose individuals to heritable thoracic aortic disease (HTAD), but
limited data are available to stratify the risk for aortic events associated with these genes.
OBJECTIVES This study sought to compare the risk ofﬁrst aortic event, speciﬁcally thoracic aortic aneurysm surgery or
an aortic dissection, among 7 HTAD genes and variant types within each gene.
METHODS A retrospective cohort of probands and relatives with rare variants in 7 genes for HTAD (n¼ 1,028) was
assessed for the risk ofﬁrst aortic events based on the gene altered, pathogenic variant type, sex, proband status, and
location of recruitment.
RESULTS Signiﬁcant differences in aortic event risk were identiﬁed among the smooth muscle contraction genes
(ACTA2, MYLK, andPRKG1; P ¼ 0.002) and among the genes for Loeys-Dietz syndrome, which encode proteins in the
transforming growth factor (TGF)-b pathway (SMAD3, TGFB2, TGFBR1,and TGFBR2; P< 0.0001). Cumulative incidence
of type A aortic dissection was higher than elective aneurysm surgery in patients with variants inACTA2, MYLK, PRKG1,
and SMAD3; in contrast, patients withTGFBR2 variants had lower cumulative incidence of type A aortic dissection than
elective aneurysm surgery. Cumulative incidence of type B aortic dissection was higher forACTA2, PRKG1, and TGFBR2
than other genes. After adjusting for proband status, sex, and recruitment location, speciﬁc variants inACTA2 and
TGFBR2 were associated with substantially higher risk of aortic event with childhood onset.
CONCLUSIONS Gene- and variant-speciﬁc data on aortic events in individuals with HTAD support personalized aortic
surveillance and clinical management. (J Am Coll Cardiol 2022;80:857–869) © 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

A
s thoracic aortic aneurysms progres-
sively enlarge, the risk for life-
threatening type A aortic dissections
increases. These dissections are preventable
if at-risk individuals are identiﬁed early and
aneurysms surgically repaired in a timely
manner.
1,2 Less deadly type B aortic dissec-
tions are also part of the thoracic aortic dis-
ease spectrum, but typically occur with
little or no prior enlargement.
3 Pathogenic
variants in both FBN1 and the genes encod-
ing proteins involved in the canonical trans-
forming growth factor (TGF)-
b signaling
pathway predispose to highly penetrant
thoracic aortic disease in patients with Mar-
fan syndrome (MFS) and Loeys-Dietz syn-
drome (LDS), respectively.
4-8 Importantly,
up to 20% of patients with thoracic aortic
disease, but without syndromic features,
have a family history of the disease.
9
Although both FBN1 and TGFb gene patho-
genic variants can be responsible for nonsyndromic
heritable thoracic aortic disease (HTAD) in families,
additional genes have been identi ﬁed that cause
HTAD without MFS or LDS systemic features.
10-13
Eleven genes have a de ﬁnitive association with
HTAD, and based on protein function, these genes
are FBN1, LOX, and COL3A1 (extracellular matrix pro-
teins), TGFBR1, TGFBR2, SMAD3, and TGFB2 (pro-
teins involved in TGF b signaling pathway), and
ACTA2, MYH11, PRKG1, and MYLK (proteins involved
in smooth muscle contraction [SMC]).14,15
Clinical management of thoracic aortic disease in
patients with MFS has progressively improved over
the past 60 years. The initial reports of patients with
LDS and pathogenic variants in TGFBR1 or TGFBR2
represented the severe end of the phenotypic spec-
trum and led to more aggressive aortic disease man-
agement recommendations than those for patients
with MFS.
7,16 The Montalcino Aortic Consortium
(MAC) was established to de ﬁne the natural history
associated with the full spectrum of pathogenic var-
iants in novel HTAD genes. The MAC initially
assembled data on individuals with TGFBR1 and
TGFBR2 pathogenic variants
17 followed by data on
SMAD3 variants, 18 a n du s e dt h e s ed a t at or eﬁne rec-
ommendations for management of aortic disease in
these patients. The MAC has also examined risk and
made management recommendations for individuals
with pathogenic variants in ACTA2 and MYLK.
19,20 In
this study, we directly compared the risk ofﬁrst aortic
event (ie, elective aortic aneurysm surgery or acute
aortic dissection) among 7 HTAD genes, and speciﬁc
variants within these genes, to more accurately
compare and contrast the associated aortic disease
risk.
METHODS
STUDY POPULATION. Genotype and clinical data
from cohorts of patients and their relatives with rare
variants in ACTA2 , MYLK, PRKG1, TGFBR1 , TGFBR2 ,
SMAD3, and TGFB2 were combined for these ana-
lyses. Patient recruitment, data collection, and sites
were previously described.
17,18 This study was
reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review
Boards of UTHealth and the sites of recruitment.
Informed consent and/or authorization to use de-
identi ﬁed data for research were obtained by
participating instituti ons. Detailed methods are
available in the Supplemental Appendix .
STATISTICAL METHODS. First aortic event, de ﬁned
as any elective aortic aneurysm surgery or any aortic
dissection, was the primary outcome. Individual ﬁrst
aortic events of elective aortic aneurysm surgery,
Stanford type A or type B aortic dissection, and un-
speci ﬁed thoracic aortic dissection were examined as
secondary outcomes. Variables were summarized by
median, IQR, and minimum-maximum values or fre-
quency. Sex distribution was compared using a z test

the primary outcome was calculated using the
Kaplan-Meier method and compared between groups
by univariable Cox regression with adjustment for
family clustering. Cumulat ive incidence of individual
ﬁrst aortic events were calculated using a competing
risks analysis and compare d between groups using

the univariable analysis were included in the multi-

performed using Cox regression, strati ﬁed by gene

location of recruitment, and intrafamilial correlation
using the clustered robust method. Statistical anal-
ysis was performed using the Stata statistical package
version 16.1.
RESULTS
Data from 1,028 individuals from 376 families with
218 unique variants in 7 HTAD genes were used for
this analysis. Patients with ACTA2 variants repre-
sented 30% of the cohort, followed byTGFBR2 (23%),
SMAD3 (20%), TGFBR1 (14%), MYLK (5%), PRKG1
(4%), and TGFB2 (4%) (Table 1, Supplemental Table 1).
Of the 1,028, 456 (44%) had their ﬁrst aortic event,
deﬁned as presentation with an acute thoracic aortic
dissection (214 type A, 66 type B, and 25 unspeciﬁed
thoracic aortic dissection) or elective surgical repair
of an aortic aneurysm (n ¼ 151), at median age of 36
years (IQR: 24-48 years). Only 2 of the ﬁrst elective
aortic aneurysm surgeries involved the abdominal
aorta. Median age at last follow-up, without an aortic
event, was 29 years (IQR: 16-50 years). Eighteen
percent (n ¼ 187) were deceased at median age of 45
years (IQR: 29-56 years). Fifty-one percent of cases
were male. By location of recruitment, 60% of cases
were recruited in the United States and Canada, 35%
in Europe, and 5% in Australia and Japan.
CUMULATIVE PROBABILITY OF COMPOSITE FIRST
AORTIC EVENT ASSOCIATED WITH HTAD GENES.
Kaplan-Meier estimates of cumulative risk of com-
posite ﬁrst aortic event by grouping genes based on
the function of the corresponding protein found that
the cumulative risk ofﬁrst aortic event did not differ
between patients with variants in the TGF
b genes (ie,
LDS genes, TGFBR2 , TGFBR1 , SMAD3, and TGFB2)a n d
those with variants in the SMC genes (ACTA2 , MYLK,
and PRKG1)( Figure 1, Supplemental Table 2). Among
patients with variants in the SMC genes, cumulative
risks of aortic event were signi ﬁcantly different
(P ¼ 0.002) and highest among patients with PRKG1,
followed by those with ACTA2 and MYLK variants.
Similarly, cumulative risks of aortic event differed
signi ﬁcantly among patients with variants in the
TGF
b genes (P < 0.0001), with the highest and lowest
risk observed for TGFBR2 and SMAD3 ,r e s p e c t i v e l y .
Overall, cumulative risk of composite aortic event
at age 65 years was 70% (95% CI: 66.0– 74.5). Risk of

type A aortic dissection than elective aortic aneurysm
surgery was observed in patients with TGFBR2 and
TGFB2 variants, whereas the cumulative incidence of
these events did not differ in patients with TGFBR1
variants. When relatives only were analyzed, these
patterns persisted for ACTA2 , PRKG1, MYLK, TGFB2,
and TGFBR1 ; however, cumulative incidences of
type A dissection and elective aneurysm surgery
were similar in relatives with SMAD3 and
TGFBR2 variants.
The cumulative incidences of individualﬁrst aortic

comparison tests with adjustment for family clus-

incidence of type A aortic dissection at age 65 years
was signi ﬁcantly higher for ACTA2 compared with
TGFBR2 (P ¼ 0.049) but was not statistically different
compared with the other genes. There was a signiﬁ-

variants in other HTAD genes.
ADJUSTED AND UNADJUSTED RISK OF COMPOSITE
FIRST AORTIC EVENT BY VARIANT TYPE. The risk of
ﬁrst aortic event associat ed with different variant
types, within the individual genes, was examined by
analysis of subgroups of 10 or more individuals
(related and unrelated) carrying variants predicted to
result in a similar effect on the protein, speci ﬁcally
haploinsuf ﬁciency (entire gene deletion, exon de-
letions and truncating variants resulting in premature
truncation and nonsense-mediated decay [PTC-
NMD]), truncated proteins (PTC-nonNMD), missense
substitutions, and recurrent missense variants dis-
rupting the same amino acid. A list of variants and
variant types, as well as median age at ﬁrst aortic
event or last follow-up without an event, are shown in

Here, we show different event rates with age for spe-

TGFBR2 (Figure 1). In addition, Arg487 substitutions in
TGFBR1 conferred a higher risk for aortic events.
Comparison of variant types by univariable Cox
regression identi ﬁed variant type(s) with signiﬁcantly
different risks than the reference ( Table 3 ). Multi-
variable analysis con ﬁrmed that some variant types
were associated with signi ﬁcantly different aortic
event risks after adjusting for sex, proband status,
and location of recruitment (Table 3). For ACTA2,r i s k
of Arg179 missense substitutions was signi ﬁcantly
higher (HR: 5.89; 95% CI: 3.02 – 11.48), whereas the
Arg118 (HR: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.34– 0.79) and other vari-
a n t s( H R :0 . 4 3 ;9 5 %C I :0 . 2 6– 0.72) were signiﬁcantly
lower compared with the reference variant type,
Arg149 missense substitutions. Similarly, risk of
aortic event was signi ﬁcantly higher for missense
variants in TGFB2 (2.23; 95% CI: 1.11– 4.50) and lower
for PTC-nonNMD variant s (HR: 0.32; 95% CI: 0.12 –
0.86) compared with the reference, PTC-NMD vari-
ants. Among the SMAD3 variant types, only Arg279
was signiﬁcantly different from the reference, PTC-
NMD variants, with HR: 1.76 (95% CI: 1.01 – 3.06).
Adjusted risk of aortic event of TGFBR1 Arg487 sub-
stitutions was signiﬁcantly higher than all other var-
iants in TGFBR1 . Last, adjusted risks of aortic event
associated with TGFBR2 Arg528 and Arg537 sub-
stitutions (HR: 11.76; 95% CI: 6.17– 22.40 and HR: 1.95;
95% CI: 1.03 – 3.69, respectively) were signi ﬁcantly
higher compared with the reference, Arg460 sub-
stitutions, but all other TGFBR2 variants, including
PTC-nonNMD variants, were not signi ﬁcantly
different from the Arg460 g roup. Other variants in
TGFBR2 and TGFBR1 (Figure 1,
Supplemental Table 1)
may be associated with childhood events and higher
than average risks but could not be analyzed sepa-
rately because of the small numbers of cases.

location of recruitment showed these factors in ﬂu-
enced risk of aortic event with variable effects
depending on the gene. Adjusted risk of aortic event
was signiﬁcantly higher in male than female patients,
as previously reported for ACTA2 and TGFBR1 ,b u t
also for TGFB2 (HR: 3.49; 95% CI: 1.41 – 8.64) and
TGFBR2 (HR: 1.53; 95% CI: 1.04 – 2.23). Location of
recruitment also appeared to signi ﬁcantly inﬂuence
risk of aortic event, particularly in patients with
MYLK or SMAD3 variants who had a higher and lower
risk of aortic events, respectively, when recruited in
Europe compared with North America.
DISCUSSION
These data from the Montalcino Aortic Consortium
illustrate the intergenic and intragenic variability of
both risk for and type ofﬁrst aortic events associated
with 7 genes for HTAD, information critical for the
clinical management of these patients ( Central
Illustration ). For example, the results delineate
individuals with early-onset and aggressive thoracic
aortic disease and, conversely, individuals at risk for
late-onset, low-penetrant aortic disease. Initial de-
scriptions of LDS were of children and young adults
with TGFBR1 and TGFBR2 pathogenic variants at the
severe end of the phenotypic spectrum, with marked
syndromic features and aggressive aortic disease
associated with a high risk of dissection.
16 The MAC
sought to de ﬁne the broader spectrum of disease
associated with all HTAD g enes. This study shows
that pathogenic variants in SMC and TGF b genes
confer a similar risk for ﬁrst aortic event. Surpris-
ingly, SMC genes are associated with a signi ﬁcantly
higher risk for aortic dissections than TGF b genes,
with thePRKG1 group associated with the highest risk
for any aortic dissection or aortic event. ACTA2 ,
MYLK, and PRKG1 variants have a higher risk of pre-
senting with type A aortic dissections than elective
aneurysm surgery, regardless of proband status. At
t h es a m et i m e ,TGFBR1 and TGFBR2 groups have the
highest burden of childhood-onset aortic events.

There were few childhood-onset events associated
with ACTA2 (mostly due to the Arg179 variant) and
only rare childhood aortic events associated with
TGFB2, SMAD3, PRKG1, and MYLK.
The higher risk for dissections associated with SMC
genes could be because of type A dissections occur-
ring without signiﬁcant enlargement of the aorta. The
PRKG1 pathogenic variant is associated with dissec-
tions at signi ﬁcantly younger ages than aneurysm
repair as well as type A dissections occurring with
minimal to no aortic enlargement.
11 Similarly, type A
dissections in MYLK mutation carriers can also occur
with little to no enlargement of the aorta. 20 In
contrast, most ACTA2 mutation carriers have dilation
of the aorta before type A dissections, raising the
alternative hypothesis that a lack of syndromic fea-
t u r e si sd e l a y i n gt h ed i a g n o s i so fH T A Da n dl e a d i n gt o
dissections.
19,22 Further supporting this alternative
hypothesis is the fact that the SMAD3 group had a
higher incidence of presentation with type A dissec-
tions and lower elective aneurysm surgery than the
other LDS genes, and the individuals with SMAD3
variants have fewer LDS features and instead have
atypical complications not observed with other LDS
genes, including early-onset osteoarthritis and age-
related Charcot-Marie-Tooth-like neuropathy.
23,24
Also, TGFB2 pathogenic variants are associated with
signi ﬁcant MFS features, 6 and the TGFB2 cases less
commonly presented with type A dissections. These
data emphasize that in the absence of syndromic
features, a family history of thoracic aortic disease is
the only clinical ﬁnding that identi ﬁes individuals
who have a high risk for aortic dissections due to
HTAD.
There was a signiﬁcantly higher incidence of pre-
senting with type B aortic dissections in patients with
ACTA2 , PRKG1, and TGFBR2 variants when compared
w i t ht h eo t h e rg e n e s ,a n dw h e nc o m p a r e dw i t ht y p eB
dissections incidence in patients with MFS.
25 Impor-
tantly, type B aortic dissections inPRKG1 and ACTA2
cases occurred at younger ages than type A dissec-
tions. Type B dissections are associated with lower
acute mortality than type A dissections, but they do
cause increased long-term morbidity and mortality.
26
Because the proximal descending aortic diameter
does not predict type B dissections, clinical markers
are limited for predicting these dissections.
27 Based
on these data, treatment with b-adrenergic blocking
agents should be considered in children >10 years of
age with ACTA2, MYLK, and PRKG1 pathogenic vari-
a n t s ,e v e ni nt h ea b s e n c eo fe n l a r g e m e n to ft h e
ascending aorta or hypertension, to reduce the risk of
both type A and B aortic dissections.
1,28
We found signiﬁcant differences in the cumulative
risk of aortic events among the TGF b genes, thus
questioning the classi ﬁcation of these genes as a
single syndrome. Systemic c omplications also differ
among these genes, for example, craniosynostosis is
associated with TGFBR1 and TGFBR2 variants and
peripheral neuropathy and severe osteoarthritis with
SMAD3 variants. 5,23 Other observations further
complicate the classi ﬁcation of disorders associated
with variants in TGF b genes: these genes trigger
aortic disease in the absence of systemic features 29;
individuals with TGF b gene variants can meet diag-
nostic criteria for MFS,4,29-31 and pathogenic variants
in another TGFb gene, TGFB3, a r ea s s o c i a t e dw i t ha

low penetrant risk for aortic events and unique sys-
temic manifestations. 32 Thus, the systematic desig-
nation of LDS to all patients with pathogenic variants
in genes that encode proteins involved in canonical
TGF
b signaling fails to communicate important gene-
speci ﬁc vascular and systemic complications. The
systemic features of LDS have been associated with
increased aortic risk in patients with pathogenic
variants in TGFBR1 or TGFBR2 and therefore may
inform vascular risk.
16,17 These observations empha-
size that the diagnosis of individuals with HTAD
should be based both on the disease-causing gene and
the clinical phenotype of the patient, a dyadic clas-
siﬁcation recently recommended for all Mendelian
disorders.
33 Thus, a patient with a pathogenic
TGFBR2 variant could be diagnosed with TGFBR2 -
related LDS, TGFBR2 -related MFS, or TGFBR2 -related
HTAD based on the presence or absence of other
systemic features of LDS and MFS.
Ak e yﬁnding of this study is that the age of onset
of aortic events can be variable among patients who
harbor the same or different pathogenic variants in
the same gene. Our data support regular, compre-
hensive aortic surveillance, beginning in childhood,
for individuals with ACTA2 Arg179, TGFBR2 Arg537
and Arg528, as well as TGFBR1 Arg487 variants. The
signi ﬁcant burden of aortic events in childhood for
individuals with TGFBR1 and TGFBR2 variants in-
dicates that aortic surveillance should begin in the
ﬁrst decade of life. Although there were no events in
childhood in the TGFB2 and SMAD3 group, an
inherited SMAD3 mutation associated with adult-
onset aortic disease was identiﬁed in a neonate with
massive aortic enlargement, most likely because of an
unidenti ﬁed second genetic hit.
34 Thus, imaging of
the aorta should be pursued at the time of genetic
diagnosis no matter the age. Follow-up aortic sur-
veillance should be based on the initial scan, the
aortic event risk associated with the HTAD gene or
the speciﬁc variant in the gene, the presence of extra-
aortic LDS features, and the family history.
Data from 1,575 patients with FBN1 pathogenic
variants (mean age 34.1 /C6 17.8 years) similarly found
that speciﬁc variant types, as well as location of the
variant in the gene, predicted a differential risk of
aortic events. There were variable effects of gender
based on genotype, that is, male sex was associated
with higher aortic event risk for all variant types
examined, with the exception of cysteine altering
variants. Based on 455 aortic events reported in this
population with FBN1 variants, the risk of any ﬁrst
aortic event was 8% (95% CI: 6.2% – 9.4%) and 64%
(95% CI: 59.3% – 69.1%) at ages 25 and 65 years,
respectively, which is intermediate when compared
with the gene-speci ﬁc risks reported in this study
(Table 2) (G. Jondeau, written communication, 2021).
35
STUDY LIMITATIONS. A limitation of this study is the
fact that probands were ascertained after presenting
with either syndromic features or an aortic event and
tend to be more severely affected, particularly in
cases with de novo mutations. Thus, analysis of rel-
atives may provide a closer approximation of the
disease risk in familial cases. Furthermore, studies

are needed to examine the role of additional risk
factors in predicting aortic events, such as family
history of aortic dissections, degree of vascular tor-

morbid conditions, and imaging biomarkers (ie, aortic
size, stiffness, and compliance).

CONCLUSIONS
Our ﬁndings demonstrate the value of the multisite
Montalcino Aortic Consortium to characterize the risk
of aortic disease associated with rare variants in
HTAD genes with adjustments for geographic differ-
ences in recruitment and clinical management. These
data emphasize the utility of genetic testing, not only
to identify family members at risk for aortic disease,
but also in stratifying aortic disease risk and tailoring
aortic surveillance and surgical management. The
accumulating data on gene- and variant-speci ﬁc
aortic outcomes for HTAD genes may be used to
develop algorithms for incorporating molecular
diagnosis, along with clinical features and family
history, into medical decision-making to improve
outcomes and minimize costs for the care of patients
with HTAD.

PERSPECTIVES
COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE:The
risk of thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection in pa-
tients with pathogenic variants in 7 genes associated
with heritable thoracic aortic disease, along with
recurrent variants in each gene, can be used to stratify
risk and predict type ofﬁrst aortic event.
TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK:Further research is
needed to clarify algorithms for surveillance and
management of patients with pathogenic variants in
these genes.
